[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
Example 2:

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

双指针经典题。 

复杂度：i走n次，j只会追赶i，所以j总共也只会走n次。两个指针总共走了2n次。时间复杂度为$O(n)$

``` C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int res = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> count;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < s.size(); j++)
        {
            count[s[j]]++;
            while (count[s[j]] > 1 && i < j)
            {
                count[s[i]]--;
                i++;
            }
            res = max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
